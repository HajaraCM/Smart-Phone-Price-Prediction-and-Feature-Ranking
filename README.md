## Overview

In this project, the “Mobile Price Classification” dataset from Kaggle.com will be used and machine learning classification algorithms will be used to predict the price range of mobile phones and rank them accordingly. It aims to classify the price of cell phone into low cost, medium cost, high cost and very high cost using which ranking will be done. 

## Motivation

In today’s world mobile are one of the most commonly used gadgets. Everyone from a child to an adult uses mobile phones these days. Mobile phones indeed make our lives easy and convenient. Earlier they are used for calling only nowadays mobile phones can be used for almost everything. And phones of this age are now called smartphones. The use of smartphone technologies in mobile applications also provides new possibilities and better performance. Today, mobile phones come with different features according to the customer’s choice and need. Among thousands of companies, offering their technology to customers, choosing the appropriate phone for an individual has become an issue. Thus, the decision-making process becomes more challenging in recent times. Before buying a phone, customers usually look for reviews to decide which phone to buy and their very first question is about the price of the phone. The main aim of this project is a comparative study of various machine learning models which analyzes and considers different characteristics and features of a cell phone would categorize the price range of the same and ranks them accordingly. In this project, the “Mobile Price Classification” dataset from Kaggle is taken which includes a training dataset that is used to train the model, and a testing dataset is used to perform predictions.

## Model Creation

* Different types of models were tried like logistic regression,support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, xgboost and gradient boost.
* Out of these logistic regression,xgboost and gradient boost were top 3.
* The conclusion were made using classification metrics.

## Model Deployment


## Future Scope

* Use multiple Algorithms
* Optimize Flask app.py
* Front-End
